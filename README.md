# Latent Diffusion Super-Resolution - Sentinel 2 (LDSR-S2)
This repository contains the code of the paper [Trustworthy Super-Resolution of Multispectral Sentinel-2 Imagery with Latent Diffusion](https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/abstract/document/10887321). In order to embed this model in your workflow, please check out [SuperS2](https://github.com/IPL-UV/supers2) under [Section 4 - Diffusion Model](https://github.com/IPL-UV/supers2?tab=readme-ov-file#4-diffusion-model) , which implements many SR models including this one and provides supplementary code

## Description
This package contains the latent-diffusion model to super-resolute 10 and 20m bands of Sentinel-2. This repository contains the bare model. It can be embedded in the "opensr-utils" package in order to be applied to Sentinel-2 Imagery. 
## Results Preview
Some example Sr scenes can be found as [super-resoluted tiffs](https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/1OBgYS6c8Kpe_JuGzWOQwOK6UYwhm-3Vh?usp=drive_link) on Doogle Drive. Scenes available:
- Buenos Aires, Argentina  
- Blue Mountains, Australia  
- Louisville, USA  
- Kutahya, TÃ¼rkyie  
- Catalunya, Spain
